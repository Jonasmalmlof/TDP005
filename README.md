# What is it?

It is a small, simple dungeon-crawler game. Every time you move one step, the enemies move one step as well. If you get close to an enemy, they stop moving and just stare at you. You attack them by walking into them. After you have attacked them, they attack you. Killing enemies gives you experience, gather enough and you'll be able to take on the boss.
